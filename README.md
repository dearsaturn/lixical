# Lixical

> This needs a better name.

For now, I recommend the much-further-along [Gibran](https://github.com/abitdodgy/gibran) library, while this is under active development. **Expect breaking changes to be pushed to master.**

I plan to implement several stemming algorithms as well as reach future parity with Gibran with Lixical.

Todo:
 * Step 4+
 * Modules for basic tokenization, counting
