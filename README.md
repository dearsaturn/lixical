# Lixical

> Let's get Lixical!

For now, I recommend the much-further-along [Gibran](https://github.com/abitdodgy/gibran) library, while this is under active development.

I plan to implement several stemming algorithms as well as reach future parity with Gibran with Lixical.

Todo:
 * Split each big Porter Stemmer step into its own module. (will refactor once step 1 is complete).
