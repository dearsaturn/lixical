# Lixical

> To be renamed to Hydn.

For now, I recommend the much-further-along [Gibran](https://github.com/abitdodgy/gibran) library, while this is under active development. **Expect breaking changes to be pushed to master.**

I plan to implement several stemming algorithms as well as reach feature parity with Gibran with Lixical.

Todo:
 * Bug fixes (2 tests are currently failing).
 * Parallelization/performance improvements
 * Tokenizer
 * Levenshtein Distance
 * Modules for basic tokenization, counting
